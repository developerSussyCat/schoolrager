        Do you realize that if Kellen Heller
        would have died, there never
        would have been a book about her?
        Honestly, The Miracle Worker is
        overly sentimental, cheesy,
        and way too dramatic for its
        own good. It’s like they’re more
        interested in turning her story
        into some inspirational legend
        rather than showing the real,
        messy, uncomfortable truth.
        Annie Sullivan comes off as this
        saint-like hero, which feels
        completely unrealistic and way
        over the top. The whole thing is
        just emotional manipulation, trying
        to make you feel something rather
        than actually understand what it’s
        like to be deaf and blind. Honestly,
        I can’t stand how fake and exaggerated
        it all feels—like they’re more
        interested in tugging at your
        heartstrings than telling a genuine story.
